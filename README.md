# âš¡ Guide: How to setup LND with PostgreSQL


## ðŸ“„ Prelude and Objective ##
A short guide on how to setup and configure a *new* lightning node using LND implementation with newly released PostgreSQL support as the default database backend. A short write-up was released by Lightning Labs: [postgres.md](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/postgres.md)

- [Install and setup PostgreSQL](#install-and-setup-postgresql)
- [Configure LND](#configure-lnd)


## ðŸ”Ž Preconditions:

This guide is based on the following setup and components. It may be different to Umbrel / Raspiblitz / MyNode / etc. frameworks as it was established on a bolt/bare metal setup running on Ubuntu. 

- setup: bare metal / bolt setup
- lightning implementation: lnd-0.14.3-beta
- database backend: PostgreSQL 14.2 (latest version in ubuntu's repository)
- node state: new node without funds and channels (âš )

It's important to mention that this is initially built as a new lightning node without existing funds or channels. Migrations between different backends (bbolt, postgres, etcd) are not yet supported (as of v0.14.3).

## ðŸ›  Install and setup PostgreSQL

Installation process of LND is omitted in this guide as this is widely described on the internet. So I assume a valid installation here and continue to setup the backend:

```sh
# Install postgresql-14 

$ sudo apt install postgresql-14 postgresql-server-dev-14

# Configure postgresql to your needs (port, datadir, logging, etc.) or just leave it all to default.

$ sudo nano /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf

# Setup postgres user

$ sudo -i -u postgres
$ psql

postgres=# \password

# Take note of your password!

\q

```

Create user and database for LND:

```sh
# As postgres user

$ sudo -i -u postgres

# Create user 'lnd' and set a password
$ createuser --createdb --pwprompt lnd

# Enter password and take note of it!

# Create database 'lndb' 
$ createdb -O lnd lndb

# Exit user postgres
$ exit
```

## ðŸ›  Configure LND:

Configure `lnd.conf`:
```sh
$ sudo nano /home/lnd/.lnd/lnd.conf
```
Edit and add your postgresql config and credentials, like so: postgresql://<user>:<pw>@<ip>:<port>/<db>

```ini
[db]
db.backend=postgres
db.postgres.dsn=postgresql://lnd:password@127.0.0.1:5432/lndb
db.postgres.timeout=0
```
