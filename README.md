## ðŸ“„ Prelude and Objective ##
A short guide on how to setup and configure a *new* lightning node using LND implementation with newly released PostgreSQL support as the default database backend. A short write-up was released by Lightning Labs: [postgres.md](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/postgres.md)

## ðŸ”Ž Preconditions:

This guide is based on the following setup and components. It may be different to Umbrel / Raspiblitz / MyNode / etc. frameworks as it was established on a bolt/bare metal setup running on Ubuntu. 

- bare metal / bolt setup
- lnd-0.14.3-beta
- PostgreSQL 14.2 (latest version in ubuntu's repository)
- new node without funds and channels (âš )

It's important to mention that this setup was built as a new lightning node without existing funds or channels. Backend migrations are not supported yet by LND (as of v0.14.3).
